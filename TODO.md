# TODO: Adjust Modal Form Layout

## Tasks
- [ ] Change modalContainer maxHeight from '60%' to '30%' in app/(tabs)/index.tsx
- [ ] Conditionally set MapView height to '70%' when showFormModal is true, otherwise '100%' in app/(tabs)/index.tsx

## Notes
- Ensure the modal is positioned above the bottom tabs to prevent overlap.
- Verify that other features remain functional after changes.
